    <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>EXORA</strong> is a vibrant and welcoming dining destination in <strong>Benicassim, Spain</strong>, where
      <em>bold flavors</em>, <em>creativity</em> and <em>excellence</em> come together in an experience that transcends
      time. Rooted in our Romanian heritage and inspired by Mediterranean influences, our bistro offers a diverse menu
      that balances comfort and innovation. From expertly crafted burgers to premium steaks and fresh seafood,
      <strong>Exora</strong> reimagines familiar favorites with a unique twist, inviting guests on a culinary journey
      that bridges tradition and modernity.
    </p>

    <p>We strive to create an atmosphere where each moment feels suspended, where flavors spark emotion, and where
      hospitality turns meals into memories. <strong>EXORA</strong> comes from the dacian concept of <em>„ora"</em> as a
      time measure and the latin and greek origins of <em>„Ex"</em> (change) and <em>„Ora"</em> (time and light, as a
      purifying and spiritually transformative force)
    </p>

    <p>Founded by <strong>Chef Florin Carnicianu</strong>, a seasoned Executive Chef, restaurant owner and culinary
      consultant from Romania, <strong>Exora</strong> is built on a shared passion for <em>culinary excellence</em>,
      <em>warm hospitality</em> and creating <em>unforgettable moments</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>THE EXPERIENCE</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>EXORA</strong> is more than just a place to eat—it is a space where <em>time slows down</em>,
      <em>sensesawaken</em> and <em>moments turn into lasting memories</em>.
    </p>

    <p>Whether it's a relaxed weekday lunch, an elegant dinner, a special celebration, or a spontaneous gathering with
      loved ones, every visit to <strong>Exora</strong> is meant to be a <em>refined timeless escape</em>—an experience
      that lingers long after the last bite.
    </p>

    <ex-nav-header name="about vision" /></ex-nav-header>
    <h2>THE VISION</h2>
    <p>
      To <strong>redefine dining experiences</strong> by blending <em>tradition</em>, <em>creativity</em> and
      <em>excellence</em>, offering guests not just meals, but <strong>lasting memories</strong> that transcend time and
      nourish the soul.
    </p>

    <ex-nav-header name="about philosophy" /></ex-nav-header>
    <h2>CULINARY PHILOSOPHY</h2>
    <p>
      At <strong>EXORA</strong>, we believe food should be both <em>exciting</em> and <em>comforting</em>. Our menu
      combines <strong>bold flavors</strong>, <strong>playful twists</strong> and <strong>expertly executed
        dishes</strong>—whether
      it's a perfectly grilled steak, a juicy burger with unexpected ingredients, or fresh seafood cooked with
      Mediterranean finesse.
    </p>

    <p>We embrace <em>creativity</em> while staying true to the essence of exceptional cuisine: <strong>quality
        ingredients</strong>, <strong>precise technique</strong> and <strong>passion on the plate</strong>. Every dish
      is
      an invitation to step outside time, to savor each bite and to experience the joy of food as a connection to both
      history and the present moment.
    </p>

    <ex-nav-header name="about location" /></ex-nav-header>
    <h2>THE LOCATION</h2>
    <p>
      You'll find <strong>Exora</strong> at <strong>Avenida Barcelona 87</strong>, just a <em>4-minute walk from the
        beach</em> and <em>6 minutes from Hotel Voramar</em>. We're tucked away in a quieter part of town, close enough
      to
      enjoy the sea breeze, yet away from the busy center.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Heads up:</strong> parking's a bit of a treasure hunt <em>:)</em>, so we recommend coming by foot, bike,
      or
      catching a ride. Trust us, <strong>the food's worth the adventure!</strong>
    </p>
